Pitchfork Preview
===========

Music discovery application that exposes Pitchfork.com reviews. Pitchfork.com/reviews does not expose the review score or any information about the genre of the artist on the list page. This makes browsing the reviews for discovery purposes reliant on browsing each review.

This application utilizes pitchfork-npm to fetch latest reviews per page and expose score as well as a blurb from the review to give you a sense of the genre of the artist.

Application built with nodejs and reactjs.
